# Filename-Translator
Currenty translates files from Russian to English

Working on changes
 <ul>
 <li>Need to fix possible rename of files (Either change the filename or make a copy with the filename translated.)</li>
 <li>Output the files as a JSON file to make it posssible to read paths from JSON</li>
 <li>Might add to choose between language</li>
</ul>
